        <h2>Visitor Comments</h2>
        <p>Jason from San Francisco - Chicago will always be the greatest major city in the US. I have never experienced more friendlier people elsewhere and that is a fact. I currently live in SF and I FAAAAHKING HATE IT!</p>
        <p>Dominique from Los Angeles - Chicago is an amazing city as there are so many things to see and do. From early to late, people are roaming this beautiful city for business or leisure. When there is wind especially in the winter it can be piercing
          cold. I don't know why it took me so long to visit this lovely vibrant city.</p>
        <p>Daniel from Danville, CA - We spent our 4th of July weekend playing tourist in the Windy City. There is much to see, do, and eat here, so yes I would recommend visiting. Chicago has the big-city feel with all its amenities (restaurants, broadway
          shows, museums) but also awesome parks and lots of public art. One thing unique about Chicago though is the wide variety of architecture styles among the many skyscrapers, each with its own story.</p>
